/// Asking for a rating, on Apple's terms rather than ours.
///
/// Two different things live here and they are not interchangeable:
///
/// * [maybeAskForReview] triggers the *system* prompt. iOS draws it, the rating
///   is given without leaving the app, and iOS decides whether to draw it at
///   all — three times a year per user, and there is no way to find out what it
///   did. So the call must be fire-and-forget: never gate anything on it, never
///   follow it with "did that work?", never show our own dialog as a fallback.
///   A hand-rolled "rate us" box with buttons is against the guidelines.
///
/// * [openStoreListing] opens the App Store page straight onto the review form.
///   No quota, because a person pressed a menu row to get there.
///
/// Finishing a quiz is the moment this app is fun rather than useful, and
/// a finished round is a person who stayed. Three rounds, not one.
///
/// The counter below exists because the prompt is a scarce resource. Spending
/// one of three yearly chances on someone who opened the app once, at launch,
/// wastes it. It is spent after a few real uses instead — and only once per
/// install, so a heavy user is never nagged twice by us on top of whatever iOS
/// allows.
